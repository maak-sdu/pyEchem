# pyEchem
Processing, analysis, and plotting of electrochemical data.

The code in this repo is directed towards the electrochemical data encountered
in the Ravnsb√¶k Group at University of Southern Denmark and Aarhus University.

The current types of electrochemical experiments include galvanostatic cycling
(charge/discharge, GC), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic intermittent
titration technique (GITT).

Current potentiostats (battery cyclers) include those from Biologic, MTI, and
Maccor.
