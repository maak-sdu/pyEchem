# pyEchem
Processing, analysis, and plotting of electrochemical data.

The code in this repo is directed towards the electrochemical data encountered
in the Ravnsb√¶k Group at University of Southern Denmark and Aarhus University.

The current types of electrochemical experiments include galvanostatic cycling
(charge/discharge, GC), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic intermittent
titration technique (GITT).

Current potentiostats (battery cyclers) include those from Biologic, MTI, and
Maccor.

## Setup and installation
The following guidelines assume that the user runs a conda distribution, i.e.,
Anaconda or Miniconda. If these guidelines are followed, all dependencies for
the `pyEchem` code will be installed.

### Create a new `pyechem` conda environment
- It is highly recommended to run the code in a conda environment dedicated to
  the pyEchem library. If the user does not already have that, such a conda
  environment, called `pyechem` and using the latest Python 3 version, can be
  created from:
  ```shell
  conda create -n pyechem python=3
  ```

### Activate `pyechem` conda environment
- When the user has a `pyechem` conda environment, the user should activate the
  pyechem conda environment:
  ```shell
  conda activate pyechem
  ```

### Install dependencies
- Navigate to the main `pyEchem` directory. Using conda, dependencies present in
  the `run.txt` file in the `requirements` directory will be installed from the
  `conda-forge` channel, when running:
  ```shell
  conda install -c conda-forge --file requirements/run.txt
  ```
- Using pip, additional dependencies present in the `pip_requirements.txt` file
  in the `requirements` directory will be installed, when running:
  ```shell
  pip install -r requirements/pip_requirements.txt
  ```
Now, all `pyEchem` dependencies are installed for the `pyechem` conda
environment. You are now ready to run the code present in the `pyEchem`
repository.
