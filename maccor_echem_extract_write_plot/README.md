# maccor_echem_extract_write_plot

This code will extract time in hours and voltage in volts exported from a Maccor
potentiostat. The Ravnsb√¶k Group has been using a Maccor potentiostat at
beamline 11-ID-B, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.

The extracted time in hours and voltage in volt will be written to two-column
.txt files and plotted as .png and .pdf files.
